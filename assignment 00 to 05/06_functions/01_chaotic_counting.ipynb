        "Fill out the chaotic_counting() function, which prints the numbers from 1 to 10, but with a catch. We've written a done() function which returns True with likelihood DONE_LIKELIHOOD -- at each number, before printing the number, you should call done() and check if it returns True or not. If done() returns True, we're done counting, and you should use a return statement to end the chaotic_counting() function execution and resume execution of main(), which will print \"I'm done.\". We've written main() for you -- check it out! Notice that we'll only print \"I'm done\" from main() once chaotic_counting() is done with its execution.\n",
